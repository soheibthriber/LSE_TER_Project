# LSE_TER_Project
This code source is writen in the context of an academic project in the master LSE (ubo 2018).
The aim of this project is to test a number of real time scheduling properties by analysing a trace generated by a real time system running on a FPGA.

We tested our programme on 6 examples of real time systems issud by Cheddar 



To compile : 
gcc  sys_parser.c systeme.c -lxml2 -I/usr/include/libxml2 -o name_of_the_excutable

****** require libxml library instalation 

 On ubuntu 2016 :
